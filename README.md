# Unix
source .venv/bin/activate

Alternatively, you can populate the database manually through the Django Admin Panel.

Log in with the newly created credentials at the /admin endpoint.

__In the project, a model must be registered to admin.py to edit its content in the admin panel!__

## Running Django development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

After this, the app should be available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.
The admin panel can be found from <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin>.
